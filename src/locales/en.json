    "title": "About Me",
    "p1": "I am a Data Scientist with a multidisciplinary background that bridges marketing strategy, applied research, and intelligent automation. My career started in marketing, where I spent two years designing data-driven campaigns and building analytical frameworks for business decision-making — an experience that shaped how I approach every technical problem: with the end business impact in mind.",
    "p2": "Published researcher with four conference papers on graph-based fraud detection (ICMLT 2026, UBMK 2025, SIU 2025). Currently focused on building autonomous AI agent systems and intelligent workflow pipelines powered by LLMs.",
    "p3": "I am also an AI educator. I design training programs in machine learning, Python, and data science, and I offer a proprietary curriculum focused on mastering AI-era skills — teaching professionals not just how to code, but how to learn and grow strategically with AI. I provide one-on-one mentorship and project consulting for career transitions into data science.",
